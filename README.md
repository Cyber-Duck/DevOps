# Cyber-Duck DevOps

## Intro

### Purpose

We want to get to know you. Please provide a response to the following
challenge at a high level. Tell us about the technologies you are passionate
about, how you would apply them and what benefit this would bring.

### Scenario

A colleague has approached you to help provision a hosting platform.

The purpose of this platform is to host a public facing web application,
which is coded using Laravel and Livewire.

## User stories

### Developer

As a developer, I should be able to move my code from my local development environment
into a production hosting environment with as little human intervention as possible.

### Business stakeholder
As a business stakeholder, I should be confident that the work we are deploying is
not going to have a negative impact on the service I depend on.

### Site reliability engineer

As a SRE, I want to eliminate as much toil as possible from the deployment process.
Please don't involve me at all in a routine deployment.

## We would like you to:

1) Propose a high level solution which will meet the needs of the users - no need
to code anything, text or a diagram is OK.
1) Submit your proposal back to us, by forking this repo, or e-mailing a submission.
